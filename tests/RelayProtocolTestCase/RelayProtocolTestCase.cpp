/*
 *  RelayProtocolTestCase.cpp - the crossplay transport's agreements with the rest of the game
 *
 *  The relay envelope itself is exercised byte by byte in tests/wasm/RelayWireHarness.cpp, which
 *  also runs under wasm32. What is checked here is something that file cannot see: three tables
 *  written independently of each other have to agree, or relay games break in ways no single
 *  table's own tests would catch.
 *
 *      1. RoomRelay::gameMessageRule()        - what the relay agrees to carry
 *      2. NetworkPacketPolicy::classifyPacket - what a receiver agrees to act on
 *      3. GamePayloadRouter::handles()        - what actually has an implementation
 *
 *  If (1) carries something (2) refuses, a relay match silently loses messages. If (1) carries
 *  something (3) does not implement, it arrives and does nothing. Both are the kind of defect
 *  that only shows up as "multiplayer is broken" weeks later.
