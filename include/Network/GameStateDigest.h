/**
    A periodic fingerprint of the deterministic simulation state.

    What this is for: lockstep only works while every peer computes the same thing from the same
    commands. Without a digest a divergence shows up as two players disagreeing about the game
    with no way to tell when it started. Packet counters cannot do this job - they say that
    messages arrived, not that the simulations agree.

    What goes in, in exactly this order and these widths:

      - the game cycle,
      - the shared random generator's seed,
      - for every house slot: whether it exists, its credits, its structure count, its unit count,
      - the number of live objects,
      - for every object in ascending object id: id, item id, original house, owner house,
        raw fixed-point health, tile x, tile y.

    What is deliberately left out: anything drawn, anything measured in wall-clock time, anything
    that depends on which player is local, and every cache or lookup table that is derived from
    the state above. Those differ legitimately between two peers of one match.

    The hash is FNV-1a over explicitly sized little-endian fields, so it does not depend on the
    host's endianness, on struct padding, or on the order a container happens to iterate in.
