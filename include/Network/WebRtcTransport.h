/**
    The browser WebRTC transport is owned by the p2pkit Emscripten SDK:
    p2pkit_wasm::WebRtcTransport (header-only, installed from the p2pkit
    dependency pinned in platform/web/package.json) wraps the browser bridge —
    the SDK's --js-library glue (node_modules/p2pkit/emscripten/js/
    p2pkit_webrtc_glue.cjs) linked next to DuneCity's own adapter
    (platform/web/dunecity_webrtc_config.js) in src/CMakeLists.txt. Only usable
    in Emscripten builds; native desktop builds compile the same API as an
    inert stub so NetworkManager stays buildable everywhere. See
    platform/web/README.md for the channel mapping:
      channel 0 = control DataChannel  { ordered: true }
      channel 1 = commands DataChannel { ordered: false, maxRetransmits: 0 }
    DuneCity keeps this historical global alias so existing call sites (and the
    State/EventType/MatchRole/Event names they use) are unchanged.
