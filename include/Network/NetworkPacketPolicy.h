/**
    Admission rules for inbound ENet packets.

    These are *not* cryptographic authentication. The legacy ENet transport has no session
    keys and no encryption; a peer's identity here is "which connection did this arrive on and
    what has that connection been admitted to do". What this policy does enforce is that

      - a connection that has not finished the handshake can only drive the handshake,
      - host-only control messages are only honoured on the connection to the designated host,
      - client-only messages are only honoured by a host on an established client connection,
      - lobby-only messages stop being honoured once the match is running, and
      - a peer's identity (its name) is bound once and never re-bound during a match.

    The matrix below is derived from the real mesh handshake in NetworkManager::update() and
    NetworkManager::handlePacket(), so normal joins, late name exchange, co-op mission
    selection and config/mod synchronisation keep working.
