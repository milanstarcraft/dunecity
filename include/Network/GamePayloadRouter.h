/**
    The half of the receive path that is the same on every transport.

    Everything that reads a game packet's payload, validates it and hands it to the game lives
    here, once. The ENet mesh and the room relay both call it. What stays outside is the part
    that is genuinely transport specific: the ENet mesh handshake (CONNECT, DISCONNECT,
    PEER_CONNECTED) and mod transfers, neither of which exists on the relay.

    The point of sharing is that a validation fix lands on both transports at the same time.
