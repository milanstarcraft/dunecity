/**
    What a client may ask the host to change in the lobby.

    The host owns the lobby: it assigns a seat when a player joins
    (CustomGamePlayers::getChangeEventListForNewPlayer) and it broadcasts the authoritative
    view. A client only ever sends *requests*, and the widgets it can operate decide which
    requests are legitimate:

      - it can claim an open seat or an unowned bot seat without displacing a human
        (CustomGamePlayers::onClickPlayerDropDownBox sends SetHumanPlayer with its own name);
      - the house, team, colour and partner-slot drop-downs are only enabled for the house row
        the client currently occupies (CustomGamePlayers.cpp, the bIsThisPlayer loops), so
        ChangeHouse, ChangeTeam, ChangeColor and ChangePlayer are legitimate only for a house
        where the sender holds a seat.

    Anything else - seating another player, renaming a seat, changing a house the sender does
    not occupy - is not something the client UI can produce, so the host refuses it. The whole
    transaction is judged before anything is applied, so a list that mixes a legal and an
    illegal event changes nothing.

    This is authorization, not authentication: the sender identity comes from the connection's
    bound peer name, which the ENet transport does not cryptographically prove.
