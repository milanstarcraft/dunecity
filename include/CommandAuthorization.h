/**
    Who may act on which object.

    Every command that acts on an object carries that object's id in parameter 0 and is executed
    on *every* peer, so the decision has to be identical everywhere: it may only depend on
    simulation state (the issuing player, the object and its owner), never on which peer is
    running it or on who sent the packet.

    Command::executeCommand() resolves the issuer and the object with the existing casts and
    then asks authorizeActor() for the verdict. The decision itself lives here so it can be
    driven directly by tests with the same inputs the production path produces - the tests are
    not a second copy of the rule.

    Rules:
      - the issuing player must exist and have a house (a command for a departed or unknown
        player is a no-op, not an exception);
      - the acting object must exist and be of the type the command requires (that is what the
        existing dynamic_cast already establishes);
      - the acting object must belong to the issuer's house. Two humans sharing a house in
        co-op therefore both keep control, and a deviated unit follows its temporary owner
        because deviation reassigns ObjectBase::owner;
      - target parameters are deliberately not constrained: attacking, capturing or moving to
        an enemy object is the point of the game.
