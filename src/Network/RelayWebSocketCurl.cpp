/**
    Native relay transport on libcurl's WebSocket API.

    Shape of the thing, because it is not obvious from the outside:

      - CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY is set to 2, which is what turns an easy handle into a WebSocket
        that curl_ws_send()/curl_ws_recv() can drive instead of curl doing the transfer itself.
      - The easy handle lives on a multi handle so the connect and TLS handshake are non-blocking:
        pump() calls curl_multi_perform()/curl_multi_poll() with a zero timeout from the game
        loop. The handle stays added to the multi handle for the whole life of the socket, which
        libcurl requires while the connection is in use.
      - Receiving reassembles fragmented and chunked frames. curl_ws_recv() hands back at most
        one buffer's worth at a time and reports how much of the current frame is still to come;
        a message is complete when the current frame is not a continuation and has no bytes left.
      - Sending honours partial writes: curl_ws_send() may accept only part of a message, and the
        rest has to be offered again as a continuation of the same frame.

    /**
        Offers queued messages to curl, one WebSocket frame per message.

        The partial-write contract, from curl_ws_send(3):

          - Without CURLWS_OFFSET, libcurl writes a frame header for exactly `buflen` bytes and
            `fragsize` is not used. "fragsize should always be set to zero unless a (huge) frame
            shall be sent using multiple calls with partial content per call explicitly."
          - "If the return value is CURLE_OK but sent is less than the given buflen, libcurl was
            unable to consume the complete payload in a single call. In this case the application
            must call this function again until all payload is processed."
          - CURLWS_OFFSET with a zero fragsize continues a frame that is already in progress.

        So the first call for a message declares the whole message as one frame and passes no
        fragsize, and any remainder is offered as a continuation. Passing a non-zero fragsize on
        that first call, as this used to, was ignored by libcurl but read as if it mattered - and
        it is the parameter libcurl would start validating if it ever validated one.

        CURLWS_CONT is deliberately absent: that splits one *message* across several frames,
        which this transport never needs.
