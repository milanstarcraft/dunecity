/**
 * The browser half of a direct match.
 *
 * The game is WebAssembly and cannot hold an RTCPeerConnection, so this module owns the
 * connections and exposes a queue-shaped, string-only surface that C++ can call synchronously
 * (src/Network/DirectPeerConnectionEmscripten.cpp). Nothing here interprets the game protocol:
 * what crosses this boundary is the envelope text defined in include/Network/P2PWireFraming.h,
 * and it is passed through opaquely in both directions.
 *
 * The transport itself is the installed p2pkit package's RTCTransport in direct mode
 * (`direct: true`), used through its documented package exports - not its mesh, broadcast or
 * RPC layers. The `p2pkit/iife` export is the SDK's browser-safe surface (the same module its
 * own published IIFE bundle is built from): it carries the RTC transport and its direct-play
 * helpers and none of the node-only transports. Direct mode owns the generic safety contract
 * this bridge used to reimplement: STUN-only iceServers, hardened Chunker framing, and
 * validation/fail-closed handling of every exchanged description and candidate. Synchronous
 * acceptance for the C++ caller is the SDK's `trySend`, which never fragments partially: the
 * native side fragments exactly once too, with the same rules, so the two interoperate.
